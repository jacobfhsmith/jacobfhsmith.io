I am an assistant professor in the Political Science Department at Fordham University.

Previously, I was a visiting assistant professor at Kenyon College and taught courses in statistics, political science, and first-year writing at Duke Unversity. 

My research and teaching interests center on Congress, elections, and policymaking. I also am interested in the presidency, race and politics, research methods, and academic writing, with a focus on quantitative writing pedagogy. In my spare time, I enjoy watching British and Scandinavian detective shows, running, and following elections.
